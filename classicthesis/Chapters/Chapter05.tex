During the development of the system, there were a battery of tests run on each of the individual components to ensure their functionality and furthermore their interaction with each other when integrated in order to ensure that they work together. However, this chapter presents the more important tests run on the more complete versions of the system. After completing most of the implementation of the system's components, that is until the level of the Analysis of the data that is collected by the system, the more important phase of testing begun and in the following sections, I present the results of most of these tests and finally an evaluation of the results of these tests.
