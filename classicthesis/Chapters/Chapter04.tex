\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:conclusions}
For this chapter, the details of the implementation of the system are presented including a Component Diagram showing the particular components of the system and how they interact and share data, some of the design patterns used, some of the technologies that were helpful and necessary to the implementation of some of the system's components including their use to the system and finally, a deeper look into the particular components that make up the system and their functionalities.

\section{Component Diagram And Patterns}
This section presents the component diagram, which is composed of each of the system's components and their interaction with each other in order to complete the system's main functionality.
